This requires being able to set a ```attribute=value``` defined as ```custom-style=\"Footnote Text\"```, which allows Pandoc to apply a docx style.\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nFigure out how to either add attributes from the series or dataframe or implement a Styler component which adds attributes which get put into the jinja2 template. It\\'s clear this was intended, but not implemented.\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nThe alternative would have me making custom templates for every table I need, rather than allowing pandoc to naturally adapt styles\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\nI could probably implement this feature but it\\'s obfuscated how the render goes from accessing a cell and putting that into a render function.\\r\\n\\r\\nI assume it can be a mirror image of the ```set_table_styles``` function and instead but ```set_table_attributes``` unless the intention was to use the ```Dataframe.attrs``` or ```Series.attrs```.\\r\\n\\r\\nEither way, some clear direction could get this implemented.',\n",

Any thoughts @MarcoGorelli?\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI would expect `np.int64(ts2.asm8)` to be equal to `1672567215000000000`\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : 1b2d39cbfc3db9520e0f5455a4eb3da0f569fa0f\\r\\npython                : 3.12.1\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Windows\\r\\nOS-release            : 10\\r\\nVersion               : 10.0.19045\\r\\nmachine               : AMD64\\r\\nprocessor             : AMD64 Family 23 Model 113 Stepping 0, AuthenticAMD\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : English_United States.1252\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : 3.0.10\\r\\nsphinx                : 7.3.7\\r\\nIPython               : 8.23.0\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.8\\r\\nfastparquet           : 2024.2.0\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.3.1\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\nhypothesis            : 6.100.1\\r\\ngcsfs                 : 2024.3.1\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.4\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.2.1\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.4\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.59.1\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.10.0\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\r\\npymysql               : 1.4.6\\r\\npyarrow               : 16.1.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : 1.2.7\\r\\npytest                : 8.1.1\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : 1.0.10\\r\\ns3fs                  : 2024.3.1\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.13.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.29\\r\\ntables                : 3.9.2\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : 2024.5.0\\r\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.2.0\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.22.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

However, it requires the user to specify `bins` as either an integer or a list of bin edges. I wish it was allowed to specify `bins='auto'` similar to how `np.histogram` allows it. It internally leverages `np.histogram_bin_edges` to compute these. Thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expectation\\r\\nInstead of coding \\r\\n`pd.cut(df['x1'], bins=np.histogram_bin_edges(df['x1'], bins='auto'))`\\r\\nAllow for coding\\r\\n`pd.cut(df['x1'], bins='auto')`\\r\\n\\r\\n### Additional Context\\r\\n\\r\\nCalculation of bin edges is already done via `np.histogram_bin_edges`.
